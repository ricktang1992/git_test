git log --pretty=oneline --all --graph --abbrev-commit = which show all the commit log with a short commit_id and each log is only one line.

To avoid typing long commond line, there is a easy way to alias the code.
stepsï¼š 1. create a file named ".bashrc" in Users folder.
	2. edit "alias short_form = 'long_form' "
	such as "alias git-log='git log --pretty=oneline --all --graph --abbrev-commit'"
	3. save file.
next time, I only need to type git-log rather than log form.

touch file = create a file named "file".

vi file = edit the file.

cat file = check file.

:wq in vi = save and quit
